# Vic Torr landing — rules

- This is a single-page static site (index.html + local assets).
- Keep it minimal, dark, poster-like, no frameworks.
- Preserve existing layout and typography unless asked.
- Always keep buttons and streaming icon row centered and responsive.
- Prefer small, surgical edits; do not rewrite the whole file.
- Never break GitHub Pages (relative paths, no build steps).
